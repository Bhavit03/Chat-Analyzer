# Chat-Analyzer
This is a project based on Data Analysis and NLP, where you can upload chat files of a group or person and get the overall analysis of chats, for example, the most common words used, Monthly and Weekly timelines, emojis used, links and media shared, sentiment involved in the message of the user, etc.
The work is finally wrapped up as a streamlit web application.
